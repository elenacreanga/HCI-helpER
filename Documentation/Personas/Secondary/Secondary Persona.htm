				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Katy is a passionate and successful accountant, but since Josh 
came into her life, she decided that it would be better to keep the 
account job as part-time, in order to have more time for her kids.</p>
				<p>She has a birth sign on her face, so she knows what it's like to 
be different than the other kids. Fortunately, her mother was very 
supportive when she was a kid, so she never felt excluded.</p>
				<p>This is what Katy wants to provide for Josh too: a caring a supporting environment.</p>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>James is a passionate constructor engineer who dedicated his life to his career and his family. He worked hard to provide the best education for his children and he is very proud of their achievements. However, he feels that they are too immersed into using technology into their everyday life, sometimes ignoring him or their children. This is one of the reasons why he developed an aversion towards technology and mostly computers.</p>
